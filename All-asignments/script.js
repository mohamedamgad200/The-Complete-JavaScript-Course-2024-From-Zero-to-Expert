your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.

not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('

change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in

1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration 
called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and 
returns the percentage of the world population that the given population 
represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of 
the world population 
2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900 
and then multiply by 100 
3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice, 
store the results into variables, and log them to the console 
4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called 
'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be 
the same populations)

You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a 
variable called 'populations' 
2. Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false)

LECTURE: Basic Array Operations (Methods) 
1. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your 
choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array 
into a variable called 'neighbours' 
2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of 
your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array 
3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from 
the end of the array 
4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country â€˜Germanyâ€™, log to the 
console: 'Probably not a central European country :D' 
5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the 
index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to 
change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for 
'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.
*/
// const neighbours = ["Norway", "Sweden", "Russia"];
// neighbours.push("Utopia");
// console.log(neighbours);
// neighbours.pop();

// }

1. Create an object called 'myCountry' for a country of your choice, containing 
properties 'country', 'capital', 'language', 'population' and 
'neighbours' (an array like we used in previous assignments)

//   population: 6,
//   neighbours: ["Norway", "Sweden", "Russia"],
// };

LECTURE: Dot vs. Bracket Notation 
1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the 
console: 'Finland has 6 million finnish-speaking people, 3 neighbouring countries 
and a capital called Helsinki.' 
2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then 
decrease it by two million using brackets notation.

// and a capital called ${myCountry.capital}.`);

LECTURE: Object Methods 
1. Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method 
will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous 
assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword. 
2. Call the 'describe' method 
3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This 
method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'. 
'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if 
there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.

'Russia']];

arrays. Log a string like 'Neighbour: Canada' for each country

worry if it's too difficult for you! But you can still try to figure this out anyway
